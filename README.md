## 🧾 Brief One Line Summary
Analyzing personal financial patterns using SQL and Python to uncover insights on income, spending, and savings behavior.

---

## 📘 Overview
This project explores how individuals manage their income and expenses across different occupations and demographics.  
It identifies trends in disposable income, savings, and overall financial stability using a combination of SQL and Python-based analysis.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Most people lack clear insight into how their income is distributed across essential and non-essential spending.  
This project analyzes financial data to highlight spending inefficiencies and saving potential across various income groups and lifestyles.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains **20,000 records** with columns including:

- **Income, Age, Dependents, Occupation, City Tier**  
- **Expense Categories:** Rent, Loan Repayment, Insurance, Groceries, Transport, etc.  
- **Savings Metrics:** Desired Savings, Disposable Income, Potential Savings across multiple categories  

---

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies
- **SQL** → Querying and aggregating data for insights  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** → Data analysis & visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** → Development environment  

---

## 🧮 Methods
1. Data loading and cleaning using Pandas  
2. Exploratory analysis using SQL queries and aggregation  
3. Visualization of spending and savings distribution using Matplotlib  
4. Deriving insights on saving behavior by occupation and income
